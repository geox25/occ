Note: This project is only about 50% complete, as it likely contains a lot of bugs and is incomplete because the "bytecode-like" intermediary instructions
still need to be able to be compiled to C++.

Open Cross Compiler

Open Cross Compiler allows you to write basic instructions in a very high-level format, while
having features and speed of a lower-level language, like C++. It works by compiling your
high-level instructions to an intermediary format, and when finished will be able to compile
that to C++.
